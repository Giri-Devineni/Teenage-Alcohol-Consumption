# Teenage-Alcohol-Consumption

Alcohol is a psychoactive substance, it can lead to increase in dopamine levels during initial consumption which motivates reward based responses and results in addiction.
According to the WHO, there were over 6% of Global deaths and 5% of burden injuries reported and nowadays the consumption by teenagers is a growing concern.
The proposed Random Forest Classifier that is optimized with Grid Search  analyses the student alcohol consumption data and predicts the teenagers who tend towards alcohol consumption.
Predicting teenage alcohol consumption helps to understand and identify potential risk factors that may lead to problematic drinking behaviours in adolescents

## Applications
It helps to make Prevention programs, Health interventions, Public policy and Parental Guidance.
## Results
The experimentation results reveals the accuracy of the proposed and existing models for the prediction of alcohol consumption by teenagers.
### Proposed Model
Optimized Random Forest - 90.75%	
### Comparision Model
Linear Regression – 78.36%, 		
K-Nearest Neighbors – 83.15%, 
Naïve Bayes – 80.4% and  				
Decision Tree – 81.59% 
## Conclusiom
Based on the results obtained, Optimized Random Forest Classifier predicts better than remaining Linear Regression,	K-Nearest Neighbors, Naïve Bayes and Decision Tree.
## Limitations
The Limitations are Social desirability bias, Limited sample size, Peer pressure, Accessibility and availability.
## Future Scope
In future the consumption can be measured more  accurately by Integrating multiple data sources and performing Longitudinal studies.
